  <h2>History of The Brand</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    Douwe Egberts has since 1753 gathered a lot of experience about creating different tea blends. 1753 was the year that Egbert Douwe opened his first small shop in the Netherlands. Here he sold coffee, tea and tobacco. Until April 1937, all tea was marketed under the Douwe Egberts trademark. At that time, customers were given a tea box on which was a drawing of an English mail van. This packaging proved to be very popular and inspired to find an English-sounding brand name for Douwe Egbert's tea.

 

The director of Douwe Egberts at the time had a wife who was as fond of tea as she was of Charles Dickens' books. Inspired by his short story "Pickwick Papers", she suggested the name "Pickwick". Since then, Douwe Egbert's tea has been marketed under this brand name.

  <h2>Why choose our brand?</h2>
  <p>
    Rainforest Alliance (RA)

Honest cultivation is very important to us. That's why Pickwick picks up her tea leaves from Rainforest Alliance certified tea plantations. This way we know for sure that our tea is made sustainable and the farmer is supported. This year the Pickwick Herbal varieties RA are certified and in 2022 our goal will be achieved; the entire Pickwick tea range RA certified!

  <h2>We make a difference!</h2>
  <p>
    Ethical Tea Partnership

With Pickwick, we want to make a positive difference in the tea sector. That is why we, together with other organizations, have set up the Ethical Tea Partnership, which protects tea farmers and improves their living conditions. For example, in Rwanda, management training is given to tea farmers, they learn to invest smarter and there is more and more equality between men and women.
